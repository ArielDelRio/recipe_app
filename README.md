# Recipe_app

Recipe_app is a recipe search engine where you can find all kinds of recipes to prepare that contain a preferred food

## About

This app is multilanguage and allows you to search for recipes in English and Spanish

It also allows you to see the details of each recipe such as:

* Calories, Precautions, and Health Benefits
* Ingredients for the preparation in their weight and quantities

You can also access a link on the [website](https://www.edamam.com/) that provides more information about the recipe.

Also you can share it on social networks

## Technologies

The application was developed with [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com) was used to navigate between the recipe searcher and their details.

To make requests to the api, the [axios](https://axios-http.com/) library was used.

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used to design the page and [react-lazy-load-image-component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-lazy-load-image-component) and [react-loading-skeleton](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-loading-skeleton) were used to load and process the images, giving a more fluid appearance to the loading of images and being more attractive to the user
